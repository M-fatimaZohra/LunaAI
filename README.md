# 🤖 LunaAI - Character-Driven AI Agent

**LunaAI** is an experimental AI agent built to **mimic any character you describe** — fictional, real, or custom!  
Just tell Luna who to be (e.g., *"my best friend Sarah, an ENFP and a good listener"*) and watch it respond accordingly right from your command line.
