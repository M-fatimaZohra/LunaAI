# 🤖 LunaAI - Character-Driven AI Agent

**LunaAI** is an experimental AI agent built to **mimic any character you describe** — fictional, real, or custom!  
Just tell Luna who to be (e.g., *"my best friend Sarah, an ENFP and a good listener"*) and watch it respond accordingly right from your command line.

- 🔧 **Custom Personality Injection**: Add traits, tone, MBTI types, and more  
- 🧠 **Character Session Naming** *(v2.0)*: Give your character a unique name when starting the chat
